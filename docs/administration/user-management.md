User Management
===============

## Administering a user

To perform administration actions on someone's account, go to the [admin site](/administration/admin-site),
then click "Users" in the sidebar.

1. Use the search box on the page to find the user you would like to modify.
2. Click on the user's username to view their details.

## Making someone an administrator

To make someone a superuser (allow access to additional tabs in the dashboard),
check the box labeled "Superuser status" on the user's account page, and save.

To make someone an administrator (allows access to the admin site), check both the box labeled "Superuser status" and
the box labeled "Staff status", and save.

## Password Reset

To reset someone's password, click the small link with text "this form" underneath the password field.

The complete text is:

> Raw passwords are not stored, so there is no way to see this userâ€™s password, but you can change the password using this form.

Enter the new password into both fields and click "Change Password".
