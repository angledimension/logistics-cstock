To develop RapidSMS, you'll need to symlink
a few subdirectories into your Python path,
because we're currently developing more than
one library in a single repository.

In Bash, we do this:

  cd rapidsms/lib
  sudo ln -s * /usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages

Now all of the subdirectories (which are
Python modules) of lib are available globally.
This obviously means that you can only run a
single version of RapidSMS on each computer.

We're going to find a better way to do this,
just not right now. Relative imports sounds
good.
