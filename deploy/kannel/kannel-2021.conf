# CORE
#
# There is only one core group and it sets all basic settings

# SMSC CONNECTIONS
#

# SEND-SMS USERS
#
# These users are used when Kannel smsbox sendsms interface is used to
# send PUSH sms messages, i.e. calling URL like
# http://kannel.machine:13013/cgi-bin/sendsms?username=tester&password=foobar...

# This is the username and password that RapidSMS uses to deliver SMSes to
# Kannel.  It must also set the 'smsc' variable in the query string, so that
# Kannel knows which SMSC to use to route the message.

# SERVICES
#
# These are 'responses' to sms PULL messages, i.e. messages arriving from
# handsets. The response is based on message content. Only one sms-service is

# even if RapidSMS is offline for some reason.

# other 'sms-service' is applied.  These relay incoming messages from Airtel
# and TNM, respectively, to the appropriate HTTP backend URLs in RapidSMS.
# By setting 'accepted-smsc', we are assured that messages are routed to
# the appropriate backend in RapidSMS.
